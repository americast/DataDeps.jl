# DataDeps
--------------
WORK IN PROGRESS
--------------

This project involves building a “BinDeps.jl for data” which would make the creation of data-providing packages easier. The package would make it easy to download / unzip large files and check their integrity them in a cross-platform way. Facilities for downloading specific datasets can then be built on top of this.
